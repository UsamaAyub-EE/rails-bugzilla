# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

* Ruby version : 2.7.2

* System dependencies : I have used ActiveStorage for file uploads and the uploaded files are stored locally.

* Database creation : I have used PostgreSQL for the project. Run 'rails db:setup' to setup the database.

* Database initialization : Simply run 'rails db:seed' to seed the database

* Schema : The schema file is uploaded in the project as schema.pdf
